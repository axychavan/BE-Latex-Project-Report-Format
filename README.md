# BE-Latex-Project-Report-Format
I have created a LaTeX report format for my BE Project Report and have used this template to create various other reports as well.

Checkout the "B.E. Report Template.pdf" file to get a overview of the report.

Back in 2020, I learnt LaTeX in 4-5 days and created and used this BE report template for my BE and ME and might be useful for various other university students, engineers and scientists. I learnt LaTeX from this platform -

We can either create a LaTeX report online or offline. I prefered the offline method and used - 

(1) A Package Manager that installs missing components - MikTeX - https://miktex.org/download

(2) IDE for creating LaTeX Documents - TeXstudio - https://www.texstudio.org/

You might also checkout this video for setting up MikTeX and TeXstudio - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_idW6RzZxo

I haven't used this online editor much but I would recommend the use of Overleaf - https://www.overleaf.com/
